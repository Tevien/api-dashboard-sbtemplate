# World Bank API Data Dashboard 

This is a flask app that visualizes data from the world bank API. Data is
pulled directly from the API and then visualized using Plotly.

This is a project in development for the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree. 

## Getting Started 

This flask app can be used as a template for visualizing your own data. Use
the template to enhance your professional portfolio. 

## Prerequisites

To install the flask app, you need:
- python3
- python packages in the requirements.txt file
 
 Install the packages with
``` 
 pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installing

On a MacOS/linux system, installation is easy. Open a terminal, and go into 
the directory with the flask app files. Run python worldbank.py in the terminal.
